# Kotlin Demo Destructuring Declarations

Kotlin allows you to declare multiple variables at once. This technique is called Destructuring declaration.
Destructuring Declarations in Kotlin is a feature that allows you to break down complex data types such as arrays, lists, maps, and objects into individual variables. With destructuring declarations, you can extract values from these data types and assign them to variables in a more concise and readable way.
